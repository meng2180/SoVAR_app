The home page of the system consists of five parts, namely, from top to bottom, a menu bar, an accident information extraction result display area, an accident information extraction cumulative accuracy display area, a test case generation result display area and an accident information truth configuration area. 
When using the system to generate test cases of autopilot software and test them, first click the file menu in the menu bar and select the Import Report button, and the file selector will pop up. 
At this time, select the text file of the accident report and import it, and the system will automatically analyze the report and display the analysis results in the extraction result display area. 
If "Add information extraction record" is checked, which means that you fill in the truth value of the report and want to count the cumulative extraction accuracy of the system, then the system will compare the extraction result with the information in the truth configuration area, so as to record and update the cumulative extraction accuracy of information; 
You can also customize the configuration information in the information truth configuration area without importing reports, which means that you want to generate test cases from customized accident scenarios; 
Next, you need to click the Use Case Generation button in the File menu, and the system will generate corresponding test cases according to the information in the information extraction result display area, and then display the generated use cases in the use case generation result display area; 
If you check "Used for test case generation", the system will generate test cases according to the information in the information truth configuration area; Then, you can click the use case preview button in the file menu to preview the trajectory effect of the generated test case in the two-dimensional coordinate system; 
Finally, you can click the Recurrence Test button or Simulation Test button in the menu to test by connecting the simulation simulator. It is worth noting that the system provides a copy function for each display result, and you can copy this information for use.
